As a developer
I want to create a new publication through an API
So that i dont have to manually create one in the database.

    Background: 
        Given the endpoint https://localhost:5001/api/v1/publications is available
	
    @Publication_Creation
    Scenario: Create Publications
        When a POST Request is sent with body
          | publicationType | title                  | content                                                                       | participantLimit | prizePool | tournamentDate | tournamentHour | createdAt                | gameId | userId |
          | 1               | Example of Publication | Example of content for a publication test where i reach de minimum characters | 10               | 50        | null           | null           | 2021-11-06T17:20:14.579Z | null   | 1      |
        Then a Response with Status 200 is received
        And a Publication Resource is included in the response body.
